## 🚀 Introduction

The application exposes a REST service that allows querying the applicable final price for a specific product, brand, and date. The business logic manages rate priority when multiple overlapping date ranges exist.

### Main Features:
- **API-First Design**: The API contract is defined first using OpenAPI.
- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Clear separation between business logic and infrastructure details.
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Lite**: Use of Value Objects and domain entities to represent business logic.
- **Technical Excellence**: High test coverage and clean code.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

The project is modularized to ensure low coupling and high cohesion:

| Module                         | Responsibility                                                                                           |
|:-------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`ecommerce-api`**            | **Contract and DTOs.** Contains the OpenAPI definition (`api.yaml`) and generates controller interfaces. |
| **`ecommerce-domain`**         | **The Heart.** Domain models, Value Objects, and port interfaces. No external dependencies.              |
| **`ecommerce-application`**    | **Use Cases.** Implements application logic and orchestrates domain services.                            |
| **`ecommerce-infrastructure`** | **Adapters.** Persistence implementations (JPA), REST controllers, and mappers.                          |
| **`ecommerce-bootloader`**     | **Configuration.** Spring Boot application entry point and global configuration.                         |

## 📐 Architecture and Design

### API-First Approach
In this project, the API is a "first-class citizen."
1.  The contract is defined in `ecommerce-api/src/main/resources/openapi/api.yaml`.
2.  Using the `openapi-generator-maven-plugin`, controller interfaces and DTOs are automatically generated.
3.  This ensures that the implementation always stays true to the agreed contract.

### Hexagonal Architecture
The business logic is isolated from external factors:
- **Domain**: Defines business rules.
- **Ports**: Interfaces that define how the outside world interacts with the domain.
- **Adapters**: Technical implementations (REST, Database).

#### Framework Decoupling with Custom Annotations
To maintain the purity of the **Application Layer** and adhere strictly to Hexagonal Architecture, we avoid direct dependencies on Spring Framework annotations (like `@Service` or `@Transactional`) within this layer. Instead, we use custom annotations defined in `ecommerce-application`:

*   **`@UseCase`**: Identifies application services (Use Cases). In the Infrastructure layer (`UseCaseConfig`), these are automatically detected and registered as Spring beans using `@ComponentScan`.
*   **`@ApplicationTransactional`**: Orchestrates transactions at the application level. Its behavior is implemented in the Infrastructure layer using **AspectJ** (`ApplicationTransactionalAspect`), which intercepts calls and manages transactions through Spring's `PlatformTransactionManager`.

This approach ensures that the business logic remains agnostic of the underlying framework, making it more portable and easier to test in isolation.
